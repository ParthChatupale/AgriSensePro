# krushiRakshak Dashboard Walkthrough Script

This script helps you explain the dashboard during the demo while clearly covering two frequently asked terms: **Crop Stage** (shown inside the Crop Health cards) and **Confidence** (shown on every Risk Alert).

## Quick Definitions (Mention Before Demonstrating)

### Crop Stage (in Crop Health cards)
- Each crop card shows the current growth stage such as *vegetative*, *tillering*, or *flowering*.
- The backend derives this automatically by comparing the farmer’s **days since sowing** with the stage ranges stored in the crop metadata. The helper below returns the stage whose window matches the plant age.

```5:21:backend/app/services/crop_stage.py
    for stage, window in stages.items():
        ...
        if float(start) <= days_since_sowing <= float(end):
            return stage
```

- Example data flowing to the dashboard (`backend/data/crop_health.json`) includes the detected stage per crop (cotton → flowering, wheat → tillering, etc.), so what you show matches the backend facts.
- Talking point: “Stage tells the judge exactly which agronomic phase the Fusion Engine believes the crop is in, so every alert and recommendation respects that biological context.”

### Confidence (in Risk Alerts)
- Each alert carries a `confidence` percentage that reflects how strongly the rule engine believes the risk is real. Higher numbers mean multiple indicators fired together (humidity, NDVI drop, market volatility, etc.).

```2:12:backend/data/alerts.json
  {
    "title": "Pest Alert - Cotton",
    "level": "high",
    "confidence": 85,
    ...
  }
```

- On the dashboard we surface that number next to the priority badge so judges instantly see both **severity** (High/Medium/Low) and **certainty** (confidence %).
- Talking point: “Confidence is generated by the same Fusion Engine scores used in the advisory, so the farmer knows whether an alert is a mild suggestion or a highly certain threat.”

## Dashboard Narration Flow (2-minute segment)

### 1. Opening Hook (10s)
- “This is the krushiRakshak control center. The farmer logs in and instantly sees weather, prices, crop health, and risk alerts in one glance.”

### 2. Weather + Market Snapshot (20s)
- Highlight real-time IMD weather card (temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind). Mention this keeps farmers proactive before storms.
- Move to market card: “Prices come live from Agmarknet. The arrows show price momentum so the farmer knows whether to sell today or wait.”

### 3. Satellite NDVI Card (20s)
- Point to NDVI value, the trend arrow, and 7-day sparkline.
- Script: “We ingest NDVI from Bhuvan, grade it into Good/Moderate/Poor, and show the mini trend line so the farmer spots stress even before it’s visible.”

### 4. Crop Health Grid – Emphasize *Stage* (25s)
- Zoom into the Crop Health section.
- Script snippet:
  - “Each crop card gives NDVI, soil moisture, and the agronomic stage.”
  - “Stage is not manually entered. We compute it from sowing dates using the crop metadata windows you saw earlier. Here cotton is in *flowering*, wheat is *tillering*. This matters because our advisories, pest rules, and fertilizer tips change with the stage.”

### 5. Risk Alerts – Emphasize *Confidence* (25s)
- Scroll to alerts section.
- Script snippet:
  - “Alerts are color-coded by severity. Confidence (%) tells how certain the Fusion Engine is.”
  - “For example, this pest alert is 85% confident because humidity, NDVI drop, and historical pest outbreaks all fired at once. The farmer can also jump straight to the advisory for that crop.”

### 6. Close the Dashboard Story (20s)
- “From this one screen the farmer knows: today’s weather risk, market timing, how healthy each crop is, and which alerts deserve attention. Stage and confidence make those alerts trustworthy instead of guesswork.”

## One-Liner Recap (for judges’ Q&A)
- “**Stage** = automatically detected growth phase (derived from days since sowing) so advice is agronomy-aware.”
- “**Confidence** = probability score from the rule engine showing how strongly the data supports an alert.”

Use these lines verbatim when someone asks “What does stage/confidence mean on your dashboard?”
